Use Google Maps or an Online GeoJSON Editor:

Use tools like geojson.io or QGIS to create or export the boundary shapes for Sri Lanka's provinces.
Search for Sri Lanka's administrative boundaries and download the GeoJSON or SHP file that includes the provincial boundaries.
Validate GeoJSON Data:

Ensure that the GeoJSON file includes FeatureCollection with properties like province names (Name, ID, or Code).
Step 2: Prepare Data for Power BI
GeoJSON Data Cleaning:

Clean up the GeoJSON file if necessary to ensure it's compatible with Power BI.
For each Feature, ensure that a unique identifier or province name is present in properties.
